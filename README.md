# 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

| OOP Principle     | Implementation                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Abstraction**   | `Room` abstract class                              |
| **Inheritance**   | `StandardRoom` and `SuiteRoom` extend `Room`       |
| **Polymorphism**  | `calculatePrice()` method overridden in subclasses |
| **Encapsulation** | Private fields with getters and setters            |
| **Interface**     | `SeasonalPricing` interface                        |
